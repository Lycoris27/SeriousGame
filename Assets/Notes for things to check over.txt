Things to check later:

- How to remove second GameCanvas from Title Screen without doubling the title screen
- Check to see whether it's better to have a camera go between scenes or a canvas (having 2 canvas' in a scene doesn't seem optimal)
- make sure there is only 1 event manager in a scene at a time (linked with the canvas problem as there will be difficulties having things travel through scenes)


- insert a system whereby reaching the end of a dialogue option, the dialogue box is closed or hidden. 
- maybe possible to create prefabs for the dialogue and kill them once it reaches the end.
